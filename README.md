Hi, I’m @hydrogen602. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Physics from Trinity University. 

I'm interested in compilers and language design, functional languages, utilizing the type system to enforce invariants, web development, physics simulations, useful utilities, automation, robotics, embedded development, and many other things.
